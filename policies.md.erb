# Policy

A default policy is configured in OpsManager, this sets a best practice to ensure that queues are mirrored to two nodes by default.

This ensures you benefit from redundancy and no downtime in the case of a RabbitMQ node failing.

The following rules apply:

* The policy is only applied to new instances
* Any existing instances will not have the policy applied
* The policy can be deleted for that instance
* The policy can be updated in OpsManager and this will only be applied to any new instances created there after

## Viewing or changing the policy
In OpsManager on the RabbitMQ tile, there is a left hand manu item called `Policy`

<%= image_tag("images/policy_opsman.jpeg") %>

The policy must be valid JSON and it should use valid RabbitMQ policy criteria.
This is not validated during the deployment, so any errors could either cause the deployment to fail or policies to not be applied correctly.

## RabbitMQ Dashboard

You can view the policy on the RabbitMQ Dashboard. The URL can be obtained from your `VCAP_SERVICES` for application developers.

The policy is applied to all queues, with a rank of 50 so it can be overriden by defining your own policy with a higher rank.

You can see any new queues created have the policy automatically applied.
